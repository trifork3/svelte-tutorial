# svelte-tutorial

This repo was made for a homework in my class CS 178: Enginering Usable and Interactive Systems.

This project mainly follows the tutorial found here: https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-build-simple-svelte-js-app/.

The `svelte-bookstore` directory was created via the following: `npx degit sveltejs/template { svelte-bookstore }`

This repo's `.gitignore` was copied from the boilerplate code.
